Yes, I worked in cancer research for 7 years, mostly because I didn’t know what else to do with a biology degree that wasn’t med school or grad school.

I eventually figured out that what really motivates me is empowering people with information. A [random side project](/projects/wssr/) led me to UX, and I loved it so much I decided to do it for a job! 😄 I [cobbled together a design education](/writing/changing-careers/) for myself, then I happened to land in government, where I've been clarifying complex public services for the past 10 years. 

My dogged urge to get actionable information to people has gotten me on projects involving affordable housing, permitting, and COVID.

## About this site
<!-- The 2024 version of my website is not meant for recruiters or hiring managers. I have nothing to prove to anybody. I have already achieved everything I have ever wanted in my career, and I can’t wait to see what naturally develops next.

(Also, I am fairly certain that nobody who ended up hiring me has ever looked at my website, hah.)-->
Along with communicating what I’m about to hiring managers and recruiters, this website is for people who are new to either design or civic tech, wondering what working in government is *actually* like. Or wondering what it took for me to get here. That’s why I’ve kept my [student and pro-bono projects online](/projects/), the way I originally wrote them back around 2014.

So if that describes you, welcome! I hope what I’ve written is helpful. I’d love to meet you and give you words of encouragement. Feel free to [book a virtual coffee with me](https://calendar.app.google/WLKzHeMRDWNQ9Qzx5) or [message me on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anitaycheng).
