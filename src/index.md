# Hi, I’m Anita!

## Content designer, UX writer, information architect, occasional front-end developer, perpetual do-gooder
I’m a former cancer researcher who switched to tech to help people faster. I’ve made information and services clearer about COVID, affordable housing, and permitting for local and federal government.

I love to chat with other technologists and career-changers! [Schedule a virtual coffee with me! ☕️](https://calendar.app.google/WLKzHeMRDWNQ9Qzx5).
