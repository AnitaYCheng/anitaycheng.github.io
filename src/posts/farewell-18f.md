18F was my dream org. I first learned about it while considering UX back around 2014. I literally bookmarked the website into my “aspirational” folder. 

I’m glad I made it in before it got wiped off the face of the earth tonight. 

My first week there, I had a virtual coffee with the Chief of Staff, who told me that “18F doesn’t ship software, it ships culture.” Being new, I didn’t quite understand.

But now, at the end, I do.

The relationships I have built, the collaborative nature of everyone I met, the relentless drive to just *make things better*...you can’t destroy that. 

We’ll just grow little 18Fs wherever we end up. 

No matter what happens next, I feel heartened that we’re still supporting each other. Having had my world torn out from under my feet already with [my mom’s death](/notes/mom/) 6 years ago, knowing that people have your back is what helps the most to move forward.

By mid-day March 1, we’d already mobilized and launched [18f.org](https://18f.org/) to tell our story. Like the tagline says, “we’re not done yet.” Although as someone pointed out later, it really means we actually don’t know how to stop! 😅

I also found this in my collection. Someone had given it to me at the last 18F “IRL” (aka offsite) in DC in 2023. Figured this would happen to me. I posted it on Instagram because of course I did.

It seems poetic somehow.'", "Poetic, or a cosmic joke? Probably both." %}
